Grab your camera, put on your walking shoes and come on a photowalk down the River Thames!

Who should come on this photowalk? Anyone! Beginners, pros and anyone interesting in learning more about photography are welcome.

Join us! We’ll walk, talk, snap, and learn together.

We’ll meet outside the entrance of the Observatory in Greenwich Park at 13:00. Look for Bryn Salisbury ([picture](https://twimg0-a.akamaihd.net/profile_images/1317588157/n848360174_4588094_7425.jpg)) and Betsy Weber ([picture](http://www.flickr.com/photos/betsyweber/808907839/)).

The route is 15.1km. [http://g.co/maps/yx2wu](http://g.co/maps/yx2wu) and we will end up Westminister for some night photography followed by dinner.

Our hashtag for the walk is: #ldnphotogs
