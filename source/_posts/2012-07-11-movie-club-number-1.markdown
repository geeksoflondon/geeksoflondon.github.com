This Monday we're holding the first **Geeks of London Movie Club**. This will be a monthly meetup for fans of movies to get out of the house and enjoy a movie with other geeks.

Our first movie will be **The Amazing Spider-Man**, but the next movies will be chosen by you.

## When/where/what

* [The Amazing Spider-Man](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0948470/) in 3D
* Monday July 16th, 20:40, but we're doing food before, see below.
* On the Sky screen at the [Cineworld at The O2 Greenwich](http://www.cineworld.co.uk/cinemas/79), which is seriously one of the best screens besides the IMAX.
* Â£13.50 regular entry, but we recommend you get a [Cineworld Unlimited Pass](http://geeksoflondon.com/blog/2012/06/30/geeks-of-london-movie-club/) if you intend to come along more often and already live near a Cineworld.

## Food

Seeing as this movie isn't starting very early we decided we should meet up before for food instead of after for drinks.

* [Wagamama @ The O2](http://www.wagamama.com/locations/showlocation/730/)
* Monday July 16th, 19:00

## RSVP?

We don't have a signup for this event but [let us know on Lanyrd if you're coming](http://lanyrd.com/2012/the-geeks-of-london-movie-club-1/), it would be great to have some numbers.
