The last 3 years we've been running [BarCamp London](/barcamps). Initially as a loose group from the BarCamp community and eventually as Geeks of London. We enjoyed running them but sadly this year it looks like we're simply not going to have the time.

Between [BarCamp Berkshire](http://barcampberkshire.com), some other events we have planned for later in the year, and all of us getting jobs that are more demanding than in previous years, we simply don't have the time.

So here's a call to arms: **you** should run BarCamp London this year!

We welcome any group of people excited enough to give it a try. We might not be able to help directly but we think we've worked very hard in the last few years to make it easier for someone to take it over from us. We have a large list of regular attendees, the mailing lists, the twitter account, the domains, and most importantly the relationships with our previous sponsors.

So let us know on [info@geeksoflondon.com](info@geeksoflondon.com) if you want to run BarCamp London this year, we are looking forward to BarCamp London 10!
