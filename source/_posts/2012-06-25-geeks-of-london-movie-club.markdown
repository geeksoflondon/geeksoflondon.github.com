## Cineworld Unlimited 1 month free

If you have a Cineworld near you it might be worth looking at a Cineworld Unlimited pass. For Â£14.99 a month you get access to all the Cineworlds in the UK (except the ones in the London West End). That's less than the cost of 2 tickets at the Cineworld at The O2 Greenwich.

Sign up on [unlimitedcineworld.com](https://www.unlimitedcineworld.com) and use the code below to get 1 month extra (and get some of the Geeks of London crew one month free too):

`RAF-29LT-50GV-23GP-65KE`
