Geeks of London Ltd organises meetups for all different types of geeks, from movie geeks and comic book geeks, to scifi geeks and ice cream geeks.

We hold various events/meetups, from small meetup events to [BarCamps](http://barcamplondon.org/), [HackCamps](http://hackcamp.org.uk/), and other [unconferences](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference). Have a look at the [events section](/events) to see some of our upcoming events.
